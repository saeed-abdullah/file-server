A simple file server on top of Flask.
(Flask-Uploads is a bit too complex for the use cases that I have).


The app will read config options from the file pointed by the environment variable: FILE_SERVER_SETTINGS.
So, you should set it before running the app (e.g., export FILE_SERVER_SETTINGS=config_file_path).


There are a number of config options that you should provide (see default_config.py for more details):

* UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH: The directory location to save the uploaded file.

* UPLOADED_FILE_NAME_KEY: The name attribute in <input type=file> tag.

* FILE_NAME_SUFFIX_FUNCTION: Function to generate suffix for the saved filename. This is handy
    when there is a possibility of name collision (e.g., two files with same name from
    different users). Default is current second from unix epoch (so, as long as files
    with same name are not being uploaded at exactly same time, they would not be
    overloaded).
